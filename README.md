### Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

My name's Brett! I'm a Lead Software Engineer at [Big Cartel](https://www.bigcartel.com). I specialize in full-stack web and API development using Ruby on Rails, Stencil.js, and GraphQL. When I'm not working on code for my day job, I enjoy [making screencasts](https://youtube.com/c/Monoso), writing, cooking, and running.
