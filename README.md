### Howdy! ðŸ¤ 

My name's Brett! I'm a software engineer. I specialize in full-stack web and API development using Ruby on Rails, Stencil.js, and GraphQL. When I'm not working on code for my day job, I enjoy [making screencasts](https://youtube.com/c/Monoso), writing, cooking, and running.

- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: they/them
- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on [Projectbook](https://projectbook.code.brettchalupa.com), a collection of approachable project ideas for those learning how to code
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Rust & TypeScript
- âš¡ Fun fact: I won a chili cooking contest when I was 17, but you had to be 18 or older to enter, so I used my older brother's name and he got the credit!
