### Howdy! 🤠

My name's Brett! I'm a software engineer. I specialize in full-stack web and API development using Ruby on Rails, Stencil.js, and GraphQL. When I'm not working on code for my day job, I enjoy [making screencasts](https://youtube.com/c/Monoso), writing, cooking, and running.

- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [Soy](https://github.com/brettchalupa/soy), a new static site generator backed by portable data
- 🌱 I’m currently learning TypeScript
- ⚡ Fun fact: I won a chili cooking contest when I was 17, but you had to be 18 or older, so I used my older brother's name
