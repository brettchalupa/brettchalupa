### Howdy! 🤠

My name's Brett! I'm a software engineer. I specialize in full-stack web and API development using Ruby on Rails, Stencil.js, and GraphQL. When I'm not working on code for my day job, I enjoy making [games](https://brettchalupa.itch.io) and [screencasts](https://youtube.com/c/Monoso), writing, cooking, and running.

- 😄 Pronouns: they/them
- 🔭 I’m currently working on [making and finishing small games](https://brettchalupa.itch.io/)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Godot
- ⚡ Fun fact: I won a chili cooking contest when I was 17, but you had to be 18 or older to enter, so I used my older brother's name and he got the credit!
